# flutter_web_twitch_auth

A Flutter Web project to illustrate OAuth2 authentication flow using Twitch's API.

This implementation has been made by using Url redirection on your Flutter app and trying to grab the token inside the callback URL.

[You can also check the implementation made using an external authentication window on the branch: use-external-win](https://github.com/TesteurManiak/flutter_web_twitch_auth/tree/use-external-win)
